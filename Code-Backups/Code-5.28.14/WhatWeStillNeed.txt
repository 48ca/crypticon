A single place where we list what we still need as we approach a stable point in the project would be nice to have

James - Display.java
	1. Grey-out options like save, encode, and decode when no 'image' is being displayed.
	2. General error prevention
		When someone presses cancel on an OptionPane, hide trace.
	3. Change ratio to use height instead
		cut off image, have a view full image button.

Susanna - Steg.java
	1. Encoding length at the top of the image
	2.

Pranav - Effects.java
