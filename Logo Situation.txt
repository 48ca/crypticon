I'm thinking possibly use CrypticonLogoAltered2 instead of a blank image when the program is opened... idk tho

Also I think CrypticonLogoFewerPixelsShown would be good as a real logo in place of the java logo (if that's possible...)

you can do that with .exes, set your own logo

LMFAO we should totally encrypt the actual logo file in case any smart alec user wants to try decrypting it... it can say something funny.
(An easter egg, as google [and perhaps others] would call it)

(yeeees)
