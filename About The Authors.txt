All three authors attend Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology [as of 2014] in northern VA, USA.
They created CRYPTICON as a Freshman year computer science class final project.
Susanna and James, an item [again, as of 2014], enjoy hanging out in the Computer Systems Lab and plan on becoming Systems Admins.

Much thanks to ahamilto for inspiration, and to TJ Computer Security club for bringing steganography to our attention.
